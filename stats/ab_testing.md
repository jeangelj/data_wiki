null hypothesis

## Bias - Variance trade-off
  * Bias = missing relations between features & outputs --> UNDERFITTING
  * Variance = senstivities to small training data fluctations --> OVERFITTING


####Precision (positive predictive value)
fraction of retrieved instances that are relevant
= tp / (tp + fp)

####Recall (sensitivity)
fraction of relevant instances that are retrieved
= tp / (tp + fn)

####F1
measure of a test's accuracy
